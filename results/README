One-shot learning experiment, tested KGradientSteps and StepUntilCorrect
algorithms with various hyper-parameter values, evaluating in 300 abbreviations.
Best learning rate: 0.1 for almost all models.
Best accuracy: StepUntilCorrect(lr=0.1, max=8, extra=2 or 4), positive accuracy of 18.4%,
negative accuracy of 30.4%. KGradientSteps(lr=0.1, k=5) comes close,
positive accuracy of 17.3% and negative 34%.
PriorBaseline has a positive accuracy of 0.3%.

This is all evaluating with LearnEvalIterate. No model was useful under LearnAllThenEval.
Will probably need rehearsal for that.
