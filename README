# Pragmatic Code Autocomplete

This is the full implementation of the *Pragmatic Code Autocomplete* paper, presented at AAAI 2021:

```
@inproceedings{
    poesia2021pragmatic,
    volume = {35},
    title = {Pragmatic Code Autocomplete},
    author = {Poesia, Gabriel and Goodman, Noah},
    booktitle = {Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence},
    year = {2021}
}
```

The VSCode integration is inside the `user-study` directory. We implemented it via hooks to the [Monaco editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/),
which is the same that backs VSCode.
